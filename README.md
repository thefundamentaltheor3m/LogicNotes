# Notes on Lie Algebras

[Notes](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/LieAlgebrasNotes/blob/main/TeX_Outputs/main.pdf) for MATH70062 (Lie Algebras) taught by Ambrus Pal at Imperial in Autumn 2024. They are a work in progress.

These notes are primarily based on the content covered in lectures, with some portions based on the lecture notes and other resources (see the bibliography in the notes).

These notes were compiled by Sidharth Hariharan (who also owns this repository on GitHub). Sidharth took MATH70062 in his final year at Imperial College London.
