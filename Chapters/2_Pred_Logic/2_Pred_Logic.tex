\chapter{First-Order Logic}
\thispagestyle{empty}

The plan for this part of the module is to examine Predicate Logic, or First-Order Logic. We will examine the following, though the distinction between semantics and syntax shall not be as pronounced as it is below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \underline{Semantics:}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item First-order structures
        \item First-order languages and the corresponding formulae
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \underline{Syntax:}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item A formal system for first-order logic
        \item GÃ¶del's Completeness Theorem, which tells us that the theorems of the formal system are the ``logically valid formulae''
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Before we can begin the study of first-order logic, we need to make several important definitions and introduce the notation we will use for the remainder of this chapter. We will begin by studying structures and first-order languages. We will then relate ideas from propositional logic to ideas in first-order logic. Finally, we will build a formal system for first-order logic and give a rigorous syntactic foundation for the ideas we discuss.
