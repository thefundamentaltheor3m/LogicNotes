\chapter{Set Theory}
\thispagestyle{empty}

We now come to the final component of this module: the theory of sets. The purpose of this chapter is to motivate and discuss the results that have led to the development of the modern theory of sets.

The structure of this chapter will be as follows. We will begin by discussing naïve set theory and the motivations for the axiomatisation of set theory by Zermelo and Fraenkel. We will then state and explain some of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. We will then develop some theory and prove them using \textit{naïve} set-theoretic arguments, and mention what breaks down in the axiomatic sense when we use the axioms developed up to that point. This will motivate the addition of an appropriate axiom to make the naïve arguments valid in the axiomatic sense, all the while steering clear of the paradoxes that come with a non-axiomatic treatment of set theory.
